# Uptown-Beverly-Management-System
Implemented a housing society managment using Java, JavafFX, mySQL and Scene Builder.

1.1 Purpose
The purpose of the project is to ease the mechanism of property buying and selling. Its scope is
only the residents of our housing society. It describes a single subsystem.
1.2 Product Scope
Our software is for the residents of our housing society. Anyone who purchases a property in our
housing society may have access to the software.
1.3 Title
Our project is titled “Beverly Paradise Members Management System”. This will provide a
management software where members residing or owning properties in our housing society i.e.
Beverly Paradise can perform all necessary operations relating our housing society such as checking
updates, paying installments, giving feedback etc.
1.4 Objectives
The objective of our project is to digitalize all the operations that in past took place in our physical
offices which will now be able to take place from homes. It not only makes it easier but also faster.
1.5 Problem Statement
Our members visit our office at least once every month to obtain challan and pay the dues for
monthly development charges. The visits often increase as the needs do. With the help of our
management system, members won’t have to visit our offices. They can simply submit charges from
their homes. Moreover, if they need anything such as needing a plumber or a paint service, they can
order the services from our system. This will make the living easier.
This system will also allow us to receive feedback from users. Physical feedback isn’t very feasible
but if the members fill the feedback forms on our system, it will be feasible for them as well as us. It
will also allow us to take better steps in improving our services.
All in all, our system will make the lives of our members easier as all their needs will be solved
from the comfort of their homes. This will also attract more customers who wish to have a simpler
lifestyle.
